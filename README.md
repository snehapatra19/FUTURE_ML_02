# Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn based on telecom data.  
The model analyzes customer details such as tenure, contract type, and monthly charges to identify who is likely to leave the service.

## 📂 Files Included
- `churn_dataset.csv` — input dataset used for training  
- `Task2_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` — Colab notebook containing all code  
- `churn_predictions.csv` — predicted churn results  
- `requirements.txt` — required Python libraries  

## 🚀 Tools Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  

## 🎯 Objective
To build a simple predictive model that helps businesses reduce customer churn by identifying at-risk users.
